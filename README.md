## **🌟 Key Features**  
- **Search Users:** Enter any GitHub username to retrieve detailed user information.  
- **Default User:** Initially loads data for "octocat" when the app is first opened.  
- **Error Handling:** If a user is not found, an error message will be shown.  
- **Light/Dark Mode:** Toggle between light and dark modes using Tailwind CSS.  
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized for both mobile and desktop views for a seamless experience.

## **🛠️ Technologies Used**  
- **React**: To build the user interface and manage application state.  
- **Tailwind CSS**: For modern, utility-first styling and support for dark mode.  
- **GitHub API**: Fetches live data for GitHub users, including their profiles and statistics.  

## **🤔 What I Learned**  
- How to integrate the **GitHub API** to fetch real-time user data.  
- Implementing **light and dark mode** using Tailwind CSS with a class-based approach.  
- Handling **API errors** effectively and displaying error messages to the user.  
- Building reusable and dynamic components in **React**.  
- Creating a **responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes.


## **🎯 Purpose**  
This project was created as part of a **Frontend Mentor challenge**, aiming to enhance my skills in React, API integration, and UI design with Tailwind CSS. The app allows users to search for any GitHub user and view their profile details while providing an intuitive experience with dark/light theme switching.
